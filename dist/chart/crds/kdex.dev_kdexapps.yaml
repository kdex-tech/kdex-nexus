          KDexApp is the Schema for the kdexapps API.

          A KDexApp is the embodiment of an "Application" within the "KDex Cloud Native Application Server" model. KDexApp is
          the resource developers implement to extend to user interface with a new feature. The implementations are Web
          Component based and the packaging follows the NPM packaging model the contents of which are ES modules. There are no
          container images to build. Merely package the application code and publish it to an NPM compatible repository,
          configure the KDexApp with the necessary metadata and deploy to Kubernetes. The app can then be consumed and composed
          by KDexPageBindings to produce actual user experiences.
