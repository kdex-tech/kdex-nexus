          KDexInternalPackageReferences is the Schema for the kdexinternalpackagereferences API

          KDexInternalPackageReferences is the resource used to collect and drive the build and packaging of the complete set of npm
          modules referenced by all the resources associated with a given KDexHost. This resource is internally generated and
          managed and not meant for end users.
