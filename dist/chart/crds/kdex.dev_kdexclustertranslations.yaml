                  conditions represent the current state of the resource.
                  Each condition has a unique type and reflects the status of a specific aspect of the resource.

                  Standard condition types include:
                  - "Progressing": the resource is being created or updated
                  - "Ready": the resource is fully functional
                  - "Degraded": the resource failed to reach or maintain its desired state

                  The status of each condition is one of True, False, or Unknown.
